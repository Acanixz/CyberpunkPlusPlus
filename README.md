Cyberpunk++ is a very simple RPG made in C++, the game has 3 levels which are randomly generated and the combat system is turn-based, kill your enemies, have a chance to loot their corpses and become stronger in your path to destroy Adam Smasher, just be careful to not go cyberpsycho!

  Cyberpunk++ is a parody/hobby project and has no profit during or after its development cycle, all credits to CD Projekt RED, don't forget to check out Cyberpunk 2077! (preferably the latest version)
